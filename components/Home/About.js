          We are Joe and Mali Kramer, Digital Nomads who love to travel. We love the adventure of waking up in a new location excited to discover the world. We love the cities that we have visited, but the world is big and full of wonders and we would love to see as much as possible. We decided that it will be awesome to share the things that we love with more people. We hope you enjoy our travels as much as we do. Have a wonderful day and letâ€™s connect!

          Mali was born and raised in Mexico City and then she moved to the US with one suitcase full of dreams, after a couple of years she moved to Austin, TX where she met Joe and they have been together ever since. We love to travel, eat, graffiti hunting, and house touring wherever we go. Joe is a Software Engineer working remotely and Mali is a Marketer creating new fun ways to share our experiences.
